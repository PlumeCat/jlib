# TODO

- [ ] dag and topological sort (from tasklib)

- [ ] improve hash map

- [ ] improve heap (constructors, forwarding emplace, etc etc)

- [ ] parser combinators?

- [ ] move task engine (v4 or v5) in here?

- [x] swiss_vector testing

- [x] cancelable defer

- [ ] rewrite jenum with the __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ hack from magic_enum
(but still use the macro approach, struct member initializer trick so we don't have to do the whole range-searching thing)
